# Clarence programming language

<p>Clarence is a dynamic, embeddable scripting-language. It's syntax are highly inspired by Clojure. However, it features aweful new modifications on it's vm. With Clarence, you're allowed to write code, that even writes code for you! The entire core (vm, parser, interpreter, bytecode) is pretty small, you could implement it in nearly a weekend! It was implemented using Clarence itselfe (self-host).</p>
