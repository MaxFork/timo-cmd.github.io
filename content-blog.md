<h5> Clarence programming language</h5>

<p>Clarence is a dynamic, embeddable scripting-language. It's syntax are highly inspired by Clojure. However, it features aweful new modifications on it's vm. With Clarence, you're allowed to write code, that even writes code for you! The entire core (vm, parser, interpreter, bytecode) is pretty small, you could implement it in nearly a weekend! It was implemented using Clarence itselfe (self-host).</p>

<h5> Juno - implementing a language in one week</h5>

<p>Juno's syntax is inspired by python, scala and by Objective-C. Think a python-syntax, that is class-based(like scala) and that is finally wrapped up by an objective-c syntax. Really accurate! I've chosen those syntaxes because they match the requirements for dynamic languages. Juno is implemented in less than 660 Lines of JavaScript. This mustn't mean, it isn't powerful... Juno coveres a huge environment and concepts such: control flow, generic variable assigns, recursive functions, first-order functions, classes, superclasses, a multi-threading system and much more... I'll take you on a little trip for exploring it's syntax.</p>

<h5> ASPL - Adaptive stack-based programming</h5>

<p>Adaptive stack-based programming. ASPL (spelled: Aspel) is an esolang, strongly inspired by LLVM, Smalltalk and Lisp. Built with a stack-based gc vm. Providing an advanced, fast vram memory-based compilation.
ASPL is built on top of Clarence, that means that ASPL can produce clean bytecode. It will be needed for the bytecode interpreter mode. ASPL is built and developed for the advantage of high-performance data-parallel array programming for the GPU.</p>
